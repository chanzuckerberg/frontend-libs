## 3.0.9 (2022-10-28)

- [maintenance] Updated dependencies

## 3.0.8 (2022-07-07)

No updates. Adding new version so Lerna will publish a new release. After this, we shouldn't get any more versions that don't actually have any updates.

## 3.0.7 (2022-07-07)

No updates. Another package was updated. Is there a way to prevent Lerna from publishing new versions just because another package changed?
